# PolyglotToolkit

A mostly-coherent set of projects all in the category of free and open-source language learning software.

They may be written in any programming language and framework - whichever one makes sense for the project at hand.

Created and maintained by [yelircaasi](https://github.com/yelircaasi).

## Projects

### [parallel-text-aligner](https://github.com/PolyglotToolkit/parallel-text-aligner)

Tools for aligning pairs of texts in different languages (or different translations in the same language). 

### [parallel-text-finisher](https://github.com/PolyglotToolkit/parallel-text-finisher)

Tools for creating attractive output formats from aligned parallel texts. 

### [henry-higgins](https://github.com/PolyglotToolkit/henry-higgins)

Application for pronunciation training. Powered by neural networks, speech signal processing techniques, and speech-to-text alignment algorithms. 

### [grecromancer](https://github.com/PolyglotToolkit/grecromancer)

High-quality, end-to-end TTS for Classical Latin and Attic Ancient Greek. 

### [WiktionaryTool.jl](https://github.com/PolyglotToolkit/WiktionaryTool.jl)

Julia package for investigating cognates and borrowings, with a focus on their use in language learning.

## Roadmap

- [ ] minimal working version of parallel-text-finisher, with nice basic CLI interface
- [ ] Gale-Church algorithm coded and build in adapted version of original C code
- [ ] port Gale-Church to Cython, or alternatively make bindings to the C code
- [ ] minimal working version of parallel-text-aligner with nice basic CLI interface
- [ ] investigate Wiktionary API to determine how much needs to be done via HTML vs API
- [ ] find best Julia packages needed by WiktionaryTool.jl
- [ ] get minimal version of WiktionaryTool.jl working
- [ ] look into native compilation and distribution options for Julia (i.e. binary for people who don't want to install Julia)
- [ ] plan subsequent tasks
